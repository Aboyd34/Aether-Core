# Security Policy

This is a placeholder security policy.

Reporting a Vulnerability
- If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it privately to the repository maintainers.
- Replace this placeholder with your preferred disclosure process, contact email, or GitHub's security advisories process.

Once you confirm the preferred contact and disclosure process, I can expand this into a full SECURITY.md.
