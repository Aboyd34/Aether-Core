# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct (placeholder)

This repository uses a Code of Conduct to outline expectations for participant behavior. Replace this placeholder with the full Code of Conduct (for example, the Contributor Covenant), and include contact information for reporting enforcement issues.

For now, treat this as a reminder to add a complete Code of Conduct.
