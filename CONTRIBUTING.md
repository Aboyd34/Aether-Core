# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing.

This file is a placeholder. Typical sections to add:
- How to report issues
- How to submit pull requests
- Coding style and linting rules
- How to run tests (unit, integration, fuzz)
- Local development setup

Tell me what content you want in CONTRIBUTING.md (tests, CI, commit message style, etc.) and I will expand it.
